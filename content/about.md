"To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other, and to feel. That is the purpose of life." I heard this motto for the first time 10 years ago. Since then I have trying to live that way. 


This blog is a compilation of little moments in my life. Movies, travels, foods, and thoughts that together make me. 


Thanks for reading, I hope to find another adventurous person in you.
